My name is Ravi. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/), a software consultancy that works primarily with public sector organisations across local and central government. I'm based in Cardiff, Wales. 

## Summary

I'm a software engineer with over five years' experience working in the public and private sector. While web frontend development is my main area of expertise, I have ambitions of developing a strong set of generalist skills, and I'm always hunting for experiences that take me out of my comfort zone. To that end, I've conducted web accessibility assessments and prototyped the design of new digital services; developed event-driven microservices and APIs; written infrastructure as code in AWS; and set up serverless applications.

I relish every opportunity I get to solve new problems with an eye for providing that which meets user needs.

I believe I work best in collaborative contexts; I enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams, pairing or mobbing with teammates on a problem.
