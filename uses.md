title: What I Use
---

> *last updated Tuesday 8th November 2022*

Every now and then I'll be asked about what I use, the tech, utilities, tools et al. to do my work and beyond. I'll keep this list as up-to-date as I can.

## Hardware

- **2020 13 inch MacBook Pro; Intel Core i5, 16GB RAM**: My everyday machine, used for all of the development work I do outside of my job.
- **2020 11 inch iPad Pro; 128GB model**: I like using my iPad for general media consumption, creating vector graphics, lofi designing, composing and recording music, and writing on-the-go.
- **iPhone 13 Mini**: So you may notice there's a bit of a trend with the whole Apple thing. What can I say, I'm hooked. That said, I wish more premium phones were as small - if not smaller - than this. Can use one-handed, strong performance, decent battery life.
- **AirPods Max**: An astonishingly good pair of cans, mixing strong audio quality with Apple Continuity features, portability, active noise cancellation, the best transparency mode I've experienced, and battery life.

## Software Engineering

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A nice, lightweight code editor with great extensibility. My go-to for most work.
- [**JetBrains IDEs**](https://www.jetbrains.com/): Anytime I need a more comprehensive IDE, for instance if I'm writing Java, C#, or Go, I'll opt for one of JetBrains' solutions.
- [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/): I like to use Netlify for hosting a number of static sites I've built. It's straightforward to use and has a feature-filled free plan.
- [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/): A feature-rich, configurable terminal. I use this iTerm2 in tandem with [**zsh-autosuggestions**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [**starship**](https://starship.rs/), a shell prompt that provides some useful, visually-appealing info up-front in the shell. 
- **Chromium-based browsers**: I'm a creature of habit... but I do find the developer tooling comprehensive and easy to use.
- *I'll add more to this in due course*
